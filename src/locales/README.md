## Internationlization

The process of internationlization is pretty straight forward for Maputnik.

In order to add a new translation you'll need to create a new folder and a json file with the relevant language code and make sure all the keys are translated.
If you happen to add a feature which needs some text to be translated, the following users can help you with the relevant languages:

- English - @HarelM
- Japanese - @keichan34
- Simplified Chinese - @jieme
- Hebrew - @HarelM
- French - @lhapaipai
